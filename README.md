## Key Features Explained

### PIN Protection System
Each purchased log is protected by a unique 4-digit PIN. Users must enter the correct PIN to reveal their credentials. The PIN is encrypted and can only be used once.

### Replacement Policy
Users can request replacements for invalid logs directly from their order page. Admins can approve replacements, which will deliver a new log with a fresh PIN.

### Wallet System
Users can fund their wallets using multiple payment gateways. Wallet balance can be used for instant purchases without external payment processing.

## Admin Panel

Access the admin dashboard at `/admin/dashboard` with an admin account to:
- Manage replacement requests
- View all orders and users
- Monitor platform statistics

### Admin: Add Product Categories

1) Sign in as an admin and go to `/admin/dashboard`.

2) Open the Categories manager
   - From the admin navigation, choose Products → Categories (or Categories if shown separately).

3) Create a new category
   - Name: Display name (e.g., “Streaming”, “Social Media”, “Gaming”).
   - Slug: Leave blank to auto-generate, or enter a custom slug.
   - Status: Set to Active to show on the storefront.
   - Sort order: Optional number; lower numbers appear first.

4) Save the category
   - Active categories appear on the home page and product filters.

5) Assign products to the category
   - Edit or create a product and select the category.
   - Save the product; it will now show under that category.

Tips
- Keep names short and clear.
- Use `sort_order` to control listing order.
- Disable instead of deleting if you may restore later.

## Support

For support tickets, users can create tickets from the dashboard. Replacement requests are automatically converted to high-priority tickets.
